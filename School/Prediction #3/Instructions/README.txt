NOTICE OF CHANGE:  Had to get rid of the wonderful idea of New jersey cities (real list). I will explain in class how you could not know that there was anything wrong with you tree but it would be much worse on the test data.  Can be great lesson - but not really fair to you guys.  I want my patterns to be
possible to find not infeasible!

So here is the new one, the training data set is attached.

A data set of 1000+ couples was collected with Groom's and Bride's Ages at their wedding time, Groom's and Bride's personality types (A or B) as well as their income  when they got married. The current status of their marriage was also collected: Married, Divorced or Separated.

Buil a predictor which would predict the marriage status (3 classes: Married, Divorced and Separated), with the usual notion of error.

YOU CAN ONLY USE rpart with all bells and whistles or "clean mining". Crossvalidation required this time.

Kaggle will follow with the testing data and further instructions.
